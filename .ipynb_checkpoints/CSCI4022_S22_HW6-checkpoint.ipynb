    "Your solutions to computational questions should include any specified Python code and results as well as written commentary on your conclusions.  Remember that you are encouraged to discuss the problems with your classmates, but **you must write all code and solutions on your own**.\n",

    "**NOTES**: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Any relevant data sets should be available on Canvas. To make life easier on the graders if they need to run your code, do not change the relative path names here. Instead, move the files around on your computer.\n",
    "- If you're not familiar with typesetting math directly into Markdown then by all means, do your work on paper first and then typeset it later.  Here is a [reference guide](https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5020/mathjax-basic-tutorial-and-quick-reference) linked on Canvas on writing math in Markdown. **All** of your written commentary, justifications and mathematical work should be in Markdown.  I also recommend the [wikibook](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX) for LaTex.\n",
    "- Because you can technically evaluate notebook cells is a non-linear order, it's a good idea to do **Kernel $\\rightarrow$ Restart & Run All** as a check before submitting your solutions.  That way if we need to run your code you will know that it will work as expected. \n",
    "- It is **bad form** to make your reader interpret numerical output from your code.  If a question asks you to compute some value from the data you should show your code output **AND** write a summary of the results in Markdown directly below your code. \n",
    "- 45 points of this assignment are in problems.  The remaining 5 are for neatness, style, and overall exposition of both code and text.\n",
    "- This probably goes without saying, but... For any question that asks you to calculate something, you **must show all work and justify your answers to receive credit**. Sparse or nonexistent work will receive sparse or nonexistent credit. \n",
    "- There is *not a prescribed API* for these problems.  You may answer coding questions with whatever syntax or object typing you deem fit.  Your evaluation will primarily live in the clarity of how well you present your final results, so don't skip over any interpretations!  Your code should still be commented and readable to ensure you followed the given course algorithm.\n",
    "- There are two ways to quickly make a .pdf out of this notebook for Gradescope submission.  Either:\n",
    " - Use File -> Download as PDF via LaTeX.  This will require your system path find a working install of a TeX compiler\n",
    " - Easier: Use File ->  Print Preview, and then Right-Click -> Print using your default browser and \"Print to PDF\"\n",
